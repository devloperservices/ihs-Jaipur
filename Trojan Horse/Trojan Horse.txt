DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT

In the present scenario, there is no web where we can-
* Track the alumni globally
* Recruitment based on location and other factors of alumni directly
* No transparency in the placement ratio from each college to the public
* All the above data with authentication and security

So what our project is that the earlier scenario of tracking the alumni one by one where the load was in the heads of the college, it will be the individual who will update their data with college.
All the data from each alumni of every college will be saved and based on that data we can produce many test cases which will be benefit for any of them-
o Recruiters- they can recruit with best searches and filters like location, skill set, etc.
o College- the details of placement ratio will act like advertising them, attracting new students for admission with a smooth and hustle free tracking of alumni.
o Alumni- they will always have an opportunity to have placed in some good companies while being connected in the map.
o Students – idea where the seniors are.
