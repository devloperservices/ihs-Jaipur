What is the Problem ??
---  * IMPROPER USAGE OF ELECTRICITY IN FOLLOWING MANNER
     * IF STREET LIGHTS ARE ON IN DAYLIGHT
     * IF STREET LIGHTS ARE OFF IN NIGHT
     * LOW INTENSITY DURING FOG( IN WINTER )

So, What's the solution to it...
---  * CHANGE OF COLOR TO INCREASE THE INTENSITY
     * SENSORS FITTED ON LIGHTS SENDS THE MESSAGE TO THE RESPECTIVE AUTHORITY IF,
     * LIGHTS ARE ON DURING DAYTIME AND OFF AND NIGHT
     * SENSORS FITTED ON STREET LIGHTS SENDS THE LOCATION OF THE LIGHTS ,IF ANY FAULT ARISES
     * SOLAR PANELS ARE FITTED IN THE STREET LIGHTS ,TO REDUCE THE LOAD ON OTHER ENERGY RESOURCE
     * IF EXTRA POWER IS PRODUCED BY THE PANELS WE CAN STORE IT AND CAN SELL IT TO EARN PROFITS

Let's talk about Business Prospective!!
---  * PROFIT EARNING BY SELLING THE EXTRA ELECTRICITY PRODUCED BY SOLAR PANELS
     * LESS WASTAGE OF ELECTRICITY 
     * REDUCED OPERATIONAL COST OF STREET LIGHTS BY USING SOLAR PANELS


We have just taken some static locations with the help of HERE maps and used them to inform the fault or issue with
the Street lamp to respective authority and also increase productivity of electricity with use of small cheap sensors.
Sensors will also help in determining the intensity of lights and take action according to it.

That's all.....
Thankyou
