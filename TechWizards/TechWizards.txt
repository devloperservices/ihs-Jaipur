Description : 

Our aim is to develop an app and a hardware device which will identify potholes with real time location mounted on the gps based vehicles. 
Our model basically comprises of machine learning algorithms which will help us to predict the condition of roads based on the dataset collected.
We will also calculate the delays and traffic conditions too. Our model also categorize the type of jolts with the help of clustering algorithms.
we also predict the forthcoming potholes with the help of weather conditions, load of traffic on certain routes.
In addition to all these real time problems and inform the government about the condito of the withered roads.
we use 3-axis accelerometer and is cost efficient. We can enhance the HERE maps by intergration of this system into it.
By all this we prevent the road accidents and thus saving lives of many people.

        Arudino : This folder contains all the program files of our arudino based hardware product.
        App : This folder contains all the files of our android app.


Hosting : 

our project can be hosted on localhost by forming a xampp server and changing the IP address of the BASE URL in the RoadDetailActivity.java file in the app directory to 
the IPv4 of the current system.
