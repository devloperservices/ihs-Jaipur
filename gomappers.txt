Description of our Project:


Project Name : Trips
About Trips: 
It’s a webapp built in Django, HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap that helps travelers gain a rustic and natural experience of nature. The destinations we provide are basically rural destinations which have people that can contribute to develop and gain profits through our platform that hides all the complex process and makes it easy and smooth for both the traveler(USER) and the rural people(SERVICE PROVIDERS). We will be using HERE Maps api and microservices architecture to help our travelers choose their rural destinations that would be feasible for them and also help our users to route, reroute, reschedule their path from origin to destination based on cost estimation and traffic.
