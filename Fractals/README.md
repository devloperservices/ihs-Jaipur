## Project Synposis ‚öõÔ∏è

Many people die in India because emergency vehicles don't reach the required destination in time. There were 1,51,417 deaths due to road accidents in 2018. A two-year data from the ongoing Management of Acute Coronary Event (MACE) Registry of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) shows that more than 50% of heart attack cases reach hospital late. How many lives can be saved only if we can make the transportation of the emergency vehicles faster. According to reports an ambulance can cover 25 km in 15-20 minutes if it can get a free passage. We can create an application which can inform people in advance about an incoming emergency vehicle and ask them to free the emergency lane.
quotes Cowley as saying, "There is a golden hour between life and death. If you are critically injured you have less than 60 minutes to survive. You might not die right then; it may be three days or two weeks later ‚Äî but something has happened in your body that is irreparable."

Our project comprises of the following modules:
 1) **Informing Vehicles aout arrival of Ambulances:**Many people die in India because emergency vehicles don't reach required destination in time. Can we save life by informing people in advance about an incoming emergency vehicle. 

 2) **Automating Traffic Lights:** 

## Other 

_In our project we have developed 1 Web App, with 6 integrated components using React app_

**Current Opportunity** üöÄ : Using Vehicular Communication to transfer data will help to integrate and data flow easy and manageble.
Autonomous Vehicles need toget this feature to make more and more people aware of it.

üî•This project was made at India Hackathon Series at Arya Collegeof Engineering & Technology, Jaipur
